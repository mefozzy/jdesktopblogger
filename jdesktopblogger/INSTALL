Applications:
	- JRE 1.6.0 or above (http://java.sun.com) - needed for running the application
	- JDK 1.6.0 or above (http://java.sun.com) - needed for building the application

BUILDING
--------

To build source files simply type in the command line 
(note, the /bin directory of Ant must be included in PATH environment variable):
	ant build

For cleaning, type:
	ant clean
	
For creating one executable jar archive type
	ant main
You need to use FatJar (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fjep) if you want to build
a single runnable jar file. You might experience some problems in building the single
file outside of Eclipse. 
If the problems occur then use the following target
	ant manualCreate
It will try create a single jar file using a little hack to the FatJar creation process.
